/**
 * LearningEnvironment to play the tic tac toe game against a random player.
 * The principle of the tic tac toe is as follows. we have a 3x3 board.
 * Alternatively, each player plays a turn, and has to put a circle (for a
 * player) or a cross (for the other) in a cell. The player succeeding to align
 * 3 of his symbols in a row, column or in diagonal wins
 *
 * In this LearningEnvironment, the trained agent plays against a random algo
